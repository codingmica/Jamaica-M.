        Throughout my life, I have had many memorable experiences that have shaped my character and outlook. One significant influence during my childhood was our nanny, “Ate Rose,” who cared for me while my father worked abroad.</p>

    <p>She was like a second mother to me, filling my days with joy and nurturing. Unfortunately, she had to return to Laguna to be with her family, and I often think of her, hoping to reconnect as a teenager. Sadly, i cannot find the pictures that we have with her.</p>

    <p>
        Growing up, I cherished many joyful moments that I would describe as my own version of “Hollywood moments.” I played, traveled, and received toys that I desired; however, I was not spoiled. I understood that these gifts were made possible by my father's hard work in another country. His packages often arrived with little surprises, each feeling like a small adventure in itself. </p>

    <p>
        These life experiences have instilled in me the importance of family bonds, resilience, and cherishing those who truly matter. Each moment has played a vital role in shaping who I am today and continues to guide me as I grow. </p>
