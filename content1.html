            <p> Hello Everyone! My name is Jamaica Bianca Ann Manale currently taking a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. During my Senior High School years, I acquired a wealth of knowledge, valuable lessons, and profound inspiration. However, this period was not without its challenges
                
            <p> I experienced significant stress, struggled with coursework, and at times felt disheartened, particularly due to my lack of background in research papers. Fortunately, my teachers provided essential guidance throughout this journey.</p>
            
            <P>In the middle of our semester, I was selected by my teacher to compete in a research competition alongside two other students, including the valedictorian of our school.</P>
                
            <p>Although we did not win, the experience of presenting our research in front of judges was invaluable, contributing greatly to my personal growth.</p>
            
            <p>One of my most challenging moments occurred during our pre-defense presentation. On the day of the event, I found myself as the sole representative of my group, as my groupmates were absent.</P>
                
            <p> Walking into the room filled with Grade 12 students alongside their teammates left me feeling lost. However, I pushed through and presented our thesis. To my surprise, my teacher commended my performance, noting that my speech was well delivered. In that moment, I felt immense gratitude for the guidance I received.
            
            <p> I also graduated with High Honors and received multiple awards, including Best in Research and Best in Work Immersion. Only three students from both strands of Grade 12 were recognized as Best in Research, including myself and the valedictorian. It was a tremendous honor to be acknowledged in this way.</p>
