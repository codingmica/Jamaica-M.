    <h1>Personal Growth</h1>

    <img src="images/qw.png" alt="Personal Growth Image"> 

    <p>Throughout my educational journey, I have encountered numerous challenges that have shaped my resilience, adaptability, and commitment to lifelong learning.</p>

    <p>In Senior High School, where I initially faced difficulty due to a lack of experience with research, I learned the importance of determination and seeking guidance.</p>

    <p>Despite setbacks, such as not winning the research competition, the experience developed my confidence and public speaking skills, preparing me to embrace challenges with a positive mindset.</p>

    <p>One pivotal moment occurred during my pre-defense presentation when I found myself presenting alone. With a room filled with attentive peers and teachers, I had to overcome self-doubt and deliver the presentation solo.</p>

    <p>Through this experience, I not only grew academically but also developed greater self-confidence and the ability to stay composed under pressure.</p>

    <p>Transitioning to college and choosing to study Information Technology came with new and unexpected challenges. Initially, I struggled to adapt and found myself questioning my choice of study.</p>

    <p>However, with dedication and self-reflection, I began to develop a genuine appreciation for the field and the problem-solving skills it fosters.</p>

    <p>This realization has guided my approach to learning: embracing perseverance and nurturing a mindset that seeks growth through every experience.</p>

    <p>Each experience has contributed to a deeper understanding of my potential, building a foundation of confidence, resilience, and a commitment to excel in any field I pursue.</p>

    <p>I remain dedicated to learning, not just to reach academic goals but to continuously evolve, adapt, and contribute meaningfully in my personal and professional life.</p>
